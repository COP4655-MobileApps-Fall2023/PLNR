## Overview


### Description

PLNR is an iOS App that serves as a weekly academic planner. The app mimics the format of traditional academic planner, instead of a regular calendar.

The user would be presented with an overview of their schedule for the week, and have the ability to add tasks that need to be completed each day, as well as schedule time to set aside to complete a task.

PLNR will also notify the user when a task is coming up, or when they have scheduled time to work on something.
